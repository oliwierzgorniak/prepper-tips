          <p class="tips__modal-p">
            Wanna own a bunker, but don’t want to spend so much money on an
            ordinary one. Find a cave near your place of living and turn it into
            your own natural bunker. Now you can be safe with your friends when
            a disaster comes. If you want to scare away other people from your
            bunker put a sign nearby informing that a hungry grizzly lives
            inside the cave.

          <p class="tips__modal-p">
            Your budget can’t handle getting more food for a disaster? Ask a
            polish grandma if she wants to join you during such hard times.
            Polish grandmas are known for taking care of their grandchildren
            eating, so you won’t be starving. You might even gain some weight :)

          <h3 class="tips__modal-title">WE SAY NO TO MIND CONTROL</h3>
          <p class="tips__modal-p">
            Have you recently thought about helping your friends avoiding being
            mind controlled by the government? With my tip you can do it easily
            and cheaply. Collect a tin foil after they have lunch. Next when
            folding tin foil into hats put some garlic inside. Not only it will
            protect you from the government, but from aliens as well. Handle
            such hats to your baddies. They won’t stop thanking you.

          <p class="tips__modal-p">
            Every time you go to a shooting rage you loose a fortune? Now you
            can pay a friction of that. Next time you go to a shooting rage take
            a toy gun with you. Practice precision with foam bullets and show
            off the color of your weapon. If you don't have a toy gun you may
            use a banana as well.

          <p class="tips__modal-p">
            Do you want in a cheap way camouflage your car and you live in
            Belgium? There is a big chance that brick camouflage will work, as
            in the cities you can find them everywhere. Take used bricks and
            stick them to your car. Be sure to mark the location of it on a map,
            as you might have problems finding it.
